Climate Change Forecast for the Iberian Peninsula

In this project the goal is to compare historical data (1951-2005) of the maximum
temperature of summer with future data (2081-2100), which is predicted by the
RCP 8.5. model. We want to calculate the delta (difference between these two
temperatures) for the whole European region and display them graphically all
with the help of the climate4R package.

The climate4R package was developed by the Santander Meteorology Group at the
Universidad de Cantabria in Santander, Spain:
